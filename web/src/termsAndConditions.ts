    <p><strong>1.  SERVICE</strong></p>

    <p><strong>1.1  Access</strong>. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, DA will provide You with
        authorized access to use the DA Platform (the &ldquo;<strong>Service</strong>&rdquo;).For
        purposes of this Agreement, the &ldquo;<strong>DA Platform</strong>&rdquo; means the beta

        its sole discretion, engage, or has engaged, third-parties (&ldquo;
        <strong>Subcontractors</strong>&rdquo;) to Host the DA Platform pursuant to this
        Agreement. &ldquo;<strong>Host</strong>&rdquo; means to execute or to store the DA Platform
        or any of its sub-applications or modules on a server(s) owned, operated, or controlled by
        DA for use on a computer owned, operated, or controlled by You, without any installation of
        software source code or object code on Your computer.</p>

    <p><strong>1.3  Your Data and Applications</strong>. You may only enter mock data onto the DA
        Platform to develop custom applications (such applications, the &ldquo;<strong>Custom
            Applications</strong>;&rdquo; and collectively with such mock data, &ldquo;<strong>Your
            Data</strong>&rdquo;). You shall not use data pertaining to real world transactions or
        events, persons, entities, or subjects, including, without limitation, financial data or

        Platform (including DAML libraries). You hereby grant DA the right to use and access Your
        Data in connection with the provision of the Services, provided that DA does not (a)
        disclose Your Data to a third party, except as compelled by law in accordance with this
        Agreement or as expressly permitted in writing by You; or (b) access, use, or modify Your
        Data, except as required to provide the Service, to prevent or address service or technical
        problems, at Your request (<em>e.g.</em>, in connection with customer support matters), or
        as required for the protection of DA's rights and interests. You shall be solely responsible
        and liable with respect to Your Data.</p>

    <p><strong>1.4  Personal Information or Sensitive Data</strong>. Unless You enter into a separate
        Data Processing Agreement with DA, and except as provided in Section 11.2, You shall not
        disclose, enter, load, use, or otherwise exploit any Personal Information or Sensitive Data
        in connection with the DA Platform and/or the Service, including but not limited to in

        provide or furnish any Personal Information or Sensitive Data to DA or any of its employees,
        directors, officers, representatives, contractors, or agents. DA does not intend uses of the
        Services to create obligations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
        of 1996 (as it may be amended from time to time and its implementing regulations, &ldquo;
        <strong>HIPAA</strong>&rdquo;), and makes no representations that the Services satisfy HIPAA
        requirements. If You are (or become) a Covered Entity or Business Associate, as defined in
        HIPAA, You will not use the Services for any purpose or in any manner involving Protected

            Data</strong>&rdquo; means any information relating to an identified or identifiable
        natural person, including any and all similarly protected sensitive data; an identifiable
        natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by
        reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an
        online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological,
        genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. The term Your
        Data does not include Personal Information or Sensitive Data.</p>

    <p><strong>1.5  Loss of Your Data</strong>. In the event of any breach that compromises the
        security, confidentiality, or integrity of Your Data, DA shall notify You as soon as
        reasonably practicable after becoming aware of such occurrence. If the breach compromises
        the security, confidentiality, or integrity of Personal Information or Sensitive Data,
        notwithstanding the fact that such data is not permitted for use with the Service, You are
        solely responsible and shall be obligated to: (i) notify the affected individuals as soon as
        practicable but no later than is required to comply with applicable law, and (ii) perform or
        take any other actions required to comply with applicable law as a result of the occurrence.
        You agree to backup Your Data and any Custom Application separately away from the Service.
        You agree that DA has no responsibility to backup Your Data or any Custom Application and
        that DA bears no liability for any loss of Your Data or any Custom Application.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the terms of any non-disclosure or confidentiality agreement, if any, that may
    bind the Parties, the disclosure of Your Data due to the act of a third party and the loss of
    Your Data are addressed solely in this Section and are not covered by any other non-disclosure
    or confidentiality agreement. In such event, DA&rsquo;s sole responsibility is to act in
    accordance with this Section, and DA will not be liable to You or any other party so long as it
    meets its obligations in this Section.</p>

    <p><strong>1.6  Excessive Resource Use. If DA determines in good faith that Your
        resource usage (including, but not limited to, bandwidth, processing cycles, storage, etc.)
        is significantly excessive in relation to DA&rsquo;s policies, DA reserves the right to
        suspend Services or throttle Your access to Services until You reduce such resource
        consumption.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>1.7  Suspension or Termination</strong>. DA may suspend, terminate, or restrict Your
        access to the Service under any of the following circumstances, and in such event DA will
        provide You with reasonably prompt written notice of the reasons for such suspension or
        termination: (a) DA determines in good faith that You have violated any of the restrictions
        set forth in this Agreement, violated DA&rsquo;s Acceptable Use Policy available below
        that DA may unilaterally update from time to time (the &ldquo;<strong>Acceptable Use
            Policy</strong>&rdquo;), or used the Service for any purpose other than the Purpose; or
        (b) DA determines in good faith that such suspension is advisable (i) for security reasons,
        (ii) in response to a request from law enforcement or a governing body or in relation to
        legal proceedings, (iii) to protect DA from liability, (iv) for the continued normal and
        efficient operation of the Service or to permit DA to maintain or update the Service. If You
        become aware that any portion of Your Data or any activity violates this Agreement or any
        applicable law, You shall immediately take all necessary action to cease and prevent such
        activity and remove the portion of Your Data violating this Agreement or applicable law from
        the Service. To the extent DA becomes aware that any part of Your Data, in DA's reasonable
        discretion, is in violation of this Agreement or any applicable law, DA may immediately
        delete or remove that part of Your Data from the Service or take any other action DA deems
        appropriate. DA reserves the right to cooperate with any legal authority and relevant
        third-party in the investigation of alleged wrongdoing. Any violation of applicable law by
        You shall be Your sole responsibility of, and DA shall have no liability towards You for any
        consequences of such violation, including from the suspension, termination of Your use of
        the Service or from the deletion of the Your Data.</p>

    <p><strong>1.8  No SLA or Technical Support</strong>. Beta products, including the DA Platform, may
        not always perform as specified, and can be changed from time to time without notice. With
        respect to this beta program, You acknowledge and agree that DA has no obligation to provide

        that no Service Level Agreement (&ldquo;SLA&rdquo;) or any service credits apply to Your use
        of the Service, including with respect to any downtime. Support, if any, will be governed by
        a separate agreement between DA and You.</p>

    <p><strong>1.9  Changes to the Service</strong>. During the Beta Term, DA may change or discontinue
        the Service, including the DA Platform, at any time. DA is not obligated to provide advance
